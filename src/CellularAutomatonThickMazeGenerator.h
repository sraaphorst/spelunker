    /**
     * Cellular automata populate a grid randomly via a probability distribution, and then cells
     * go through a number of generations starting at time t=0, wherein the configuration at time
     * t=n deterministically generates the configuration at time t=n+1 according to a set of rules,
     * wherein the number of neighbours (for some defined type of neighbourhood) determines the
     * transition for each cell. Usually, a fairly steady state of stability is reached, perhaps
     * with some alternating back and forth between a small number of states.
     *
     * There is no guarantee that these mazes are perfect, or even connected: in fact, they
     * usually are not, and may contain large, open spaces; however, they are an interesting maze
     * generation technique in and of their own right, and could theoretically be used as starter
     * seeds for other algorithm.
     *
     * They tend to achieve stability very quickly, i.e. either reach a constant state that does not
     * change, or alternate between a small number of states.
     *
     * Note that these algorithms sometimes do better if the resultant mazes are reversed via a call
     * to @see{ThickMaze#reverse}.
