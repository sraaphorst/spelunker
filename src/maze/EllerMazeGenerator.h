    /**
     * This is a maze generator using Eller's algorithm.
     *
     * The idea here is to initialize the maze with all walls, putting each cell in a disjoint set.
     *
     * We begin in the upper left corner, and continue to carve east with probability p, joining the cells together
     * to represent a larger set.
     *
     * When we no longer carve east (either because the probability failed, or we reach the end of the row), we
     * go over the contiguous cells and carve one or more southern walls.
     *
     * Here, we allow a fractional parameter d, which indicates the maximum "density" of southward carving.
     * The algorithm then carves between 1 and min(1, d * size of contiguous cells) southern walls amongst the
     * contiguous cells, adding them to the set.
     *
     * Then proceed with the next row and continue iteratively until the last row is reached.
     * In the last row, carve walls between cells that are still in disjoint sets to ensure the maze is connected.
     * This will always generate a perfect maze.
     *
     * The parameters p and d, which both default to 0.5, can be played with to result in mazes with a horizontal or
     * vertical bias, i.e. long horizontal or vertical passages.
     * Note that, for low p, you get long, vertical corridors, since there is little horizontal interaction.
     * With high p and low d, you get long, horizontal corridors.
     *
     * This can be done to absurdity: for example, with p = 0.0001 and any value of d, any maze with less than
     * 10,000 cells will have an expected value of zero for number of horizontal branches, and thus, the entire
     * maze will consist of columns joined together by a single bottom row.
