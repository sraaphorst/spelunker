    /**
     * The Aldous-Broder approach to generating mazes is one of the slowest approaches, but typically
     * results in mazes without bias due to finding uniform spanning trees.
     * Note: uniform here means chosen at random.
     *
     * The algorithm proceeds as follows:
     *
     * Pick a random cell and marking it as visited.
     *
     * Until all cells are visited:
     * Pick a random neighbour and move to it.
     * If it it not visited, carve a wall between it and the previous cell.
     *
     * The reason that this algorithm is so ineffective is because there is no restriction to pick unvisited cells;
     * thus the carver meanders drunkenly about until it manages to have visited every cell, and in the process,
     * will visit many cells many times more than once.
