    /**
     * The growing tree maze generator is incredibly simplistic in its concept:
     *
     * Setup:
     * Let C be an initially empty collection of cells.
     * Pick a cell c at random and put it into C.
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * While C is nonempty:
     * Choose any cell in C, say c.
     * If c has no unvisited neighbours, remove c from C and loop.
     * If c has unvisited neighbours, pick one at random, say c'.
     *   Carve a passage from c to c' and add c' to C.
     *
     * The interesting part of this algorithm is the selection mechanism used to select a cell in C.
     * This class provides four possible selection strategies namely:
     * - OLDEST: pick the oldest cell first
     * - NEWEST: pick the newest cell first (equivalent to randomized depth-first search)
     * - RANDOM: pick a random cell (equivalent to randomized Prim's)
     * - MIDDLE: pick the middle cell first.
     *
     * but also allows the user to implement their own by supplying a function:
     *
     * \code
     * int (*)(const CellContainer &C)
     * \endcode
     *
     * that is called with C nonempty and expects the user to return the index of the candidate c in C.
     *
     * Note that elements are emplaced at the back of C, so 0 is the oldest element, and C.size() - 1
     * is the newest.
