     * A immutable 2D planar maze where walls have no thickness.
     * It encompasses a layout, as well as starting and ending positions.
     *
     * Here is a brief description as to how the layout is stored:
     *
     * If we have width w and height h, and we assume that the maze is surrounded by walls,
     * then we have:
     * 1. c = w * h cells; and
     * 2. z = (w-1)*h + w*(h-1) walls.
     *
     * Here is an example of a 4x3 maze. The bounding walls are not shown:
     *
     *  0 1 2 3
     * 0 | | |
     *  -+-+-+-
     * 1 | | |
     *  -+-+-+-
     * 2 | | |
     *
     * The maze can be fully represented by the incidence of walls. We assign a rank to the walls in the
     * range [0,z), and then represent their incidence by a vector of bool. For convenience of working with
     * cells, we have a function that takes a cell coordinates and a direction and returns the rank of the
     * wall, or -1 if the wall is a bounding wall.
